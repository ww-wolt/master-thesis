Accessing the potential of E-Waste for a degrowth transformation

What possibilities exist?



Macro

- How can the **creative reuse of old electronics** contribute to a **degrowth** transformation?

How are influenced



- How can digital tools be designed from E-Waste for use in climate activist movements?



Which possibilites exist?



Micro

- How can cloud infrastructure for activist movements be reimagined by using E-Waste?



digital tools, digital infrastructure, cloud infrastructure?





- How can solarpunk digital infrastructure be built for activist movements by using E-Waste?
- access potential of using E-Waste to build cloud infrastructures for activist movements



What digital tools exist for activist movements?



digital infrastructures for activist movements?



digital tools for climate activist movement?





Case study





Solarpunk



How can tools for activis movements be build out of E-Waste





- How can internet structure be reimagined

  


Solarpunk cloud infrastructure for activist movements



Accessing the potential of



potential of creative reuse of old electronics to contribute to a degrowth transformation?



alternative tech infrastructures for activist movements



Solar based computing infrastructure for activist movements made out of reused electronics



solar based cloud computing



building solar powered cloud computing for activist movemements



solar powered low tech cloud infrastructures for postcapitalist movements



enabling marginalized groups through



what can the west learn from global south repairing / upcycling practices



### Motivation



Interest in political dimension



immense unused resource

physicality of digitalization





### Research Method



Dual approach

- interview people for needs
- interview people that already do this kind of practices



digital tools





identifying needs for these kind of infrastructures?

intervies withh people involved in activist movements
