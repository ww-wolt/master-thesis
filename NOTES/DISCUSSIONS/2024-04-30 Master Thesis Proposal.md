# Master Thesis Proposal

### Research Question

- How can creative reuse of old electronics contribute to a degrowth transformation?

### Keywords

- Reuse instead of recycling
- Anti-Consumerism
- Low Tech
- Right to Repair
- Mitigation of E-Waste
- Degrowth computing
- Post-Capitalism
- ~~Maker cultures~~

### Methodology

- Literature review of related fields
- Field research

### Field research

Interviews as well as collection and inventarization of old electronic devices and components.

Focus on one specific industry, for example:

- Cultural institutions (Museums, Theatres Reuse of digital scenography)
- Scientific research institutions
- Transportation industry
- Manufacturing plants
- Public sector administrations
- Schools
- Hospitals / Med-Tech Institutions
