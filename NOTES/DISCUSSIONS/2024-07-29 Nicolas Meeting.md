## Research Question

How can (creative) reuse of old electronics contribute to a degrowth transformation?

- What are potentials and challenges in creating digital low-tech infrastructures from repurposed electronics for use in climate activist movements?

## General

How to deal with an overwhelming amount of literature (how to sort out what is important to me)?

How to bring climate activism, e-waste reuse and Degrowth solidly together? (weak connection?)

- **Axis 1**

  Climate Movement building their own secure, resource-saving and crisis-resilient digital tools out of E-Waste (secure and independent because of police repression / (corporate) surveillance, resource-saving because of setting a good example)

- **Axis 2**

  Climate Movement politically pushing Degrowth & Electronics Reuse (one of the loudest / most radical movements pushing Degrowth ideas)

- **Axis 3**

  Reused electronics for protests and civil disobedience (less Degrowth more activist movements in information age)

  (Tools like own secure peer to peer networks for communication, FireChat, Face Obsfuscation, Tor Nodes, VPNs)

  **Axis 4**

  Software-focused: Degrowth Secure Open Source Software inside climate movement




## Field Research



**Data Collection / Sampling**

Some contacts in climate movement and young green / socialist party that I might be able to interview. (maybe also extinction rebellion, Renovate Switzerland)

Mostly young men from german speaking Switzerland



Access to whole Google Drive of Swiss Climate Movement (lot of historical data)



Rise up for change (3. - 11. August)





How do I motivate them to participate?

How many interviews?

How to deal with sensitive information? (police anti-repression strategies, google drive data)

Audio recording? Photos?

Self-Bias?





**Research Questions**

What digital / technological tools are they using for activism?

What technical infrastructures are they relying on?

What are the resources?



**Interview Questions**

- Can you describe your roles within the climate movement?
- How long have you been involved in climate activism?
- What challenges do you encounter in your activism?
- What digital tools do you currently use in your climate activism efforts (e.g., social media, communication platforms)? Hardware & Software
- Are there any specific digital tools or platforms that are particularly crucial for organizing events or campaigns? Do you encounter any challenges or limitations with them?
- How accessible are the digital tools you use to all members of your movement, including those with limited technical skills? (maye also training, onboarding)
- Do you know cases where you know that the movement is already making use of old electronics hardware or repurposed e-waste?



### Expected results

**Tools**

Signal and self destructing messages

Server for website (self-built or cloud)

Server for cloud drive (Selfhosted nextcloud or google drive)

CryptPad for sensible documents

Low-Tech solutions for events like bicycle powered cinema



**Behaviours**

No Smartphones at illegal actions / civil disobediance

Anti-Rep Number written on hand

No real names of other people



Not a lot ongoing in the digital field yet. Lack of resources to think broader. Non existing working-groups.



**Challenges**

activist burn-out

always quite constrained time resources, usually not the time to develop their own new software / hardware tools



## Rough outline of the thesis

1. Degrowth and its relation to Technology
2. E-Waste - Huge unused resource
3. Climate Activist Movements
4. Field Research Interviews
5. Discussion
6. Conclusion
