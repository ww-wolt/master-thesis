**Building of alternatives**



Focus more generally on **grassroots movements**

- Museum für Kommunikation



**Problematic Developments of Digitization**

A) How can (creative) reuse of old electronics contribute to a degrowth transformation?

B) How can low-tech IT infrastructure contribute to a degrowth transformation?



"reappropriation of electronics"



**Field Research**

The role of low tech IT in grassroot movements

- How do (grassroot) movements in (and around) Switzerland build low-tech IT infrastructures to explore alternatives futures for a Degrowth transformation?
- What implications do these low-tech approches have?
- How is low-tech IT politically pushed by grassroots?



how do they explore alternative digital futures for a degrowth transformation?

Nearest existing design



**Motivations**

- -> interested in invisible parts of digital infrastructure
- -> interested in activities of grassroot movements active in that field around Switzerland and surrounding countries

**Keywords**

Digital Degrowth

Degrowth & Grassroot Movements







Notes

create alternatives that can inspire a Degrowth transformation?

exploring alternatives



- grassroots building low-tech infrastructures
- What is happening in grassroots movements in Switzerland to contribute to a Degrowth movemen in the digital sector?
- New ways of designing IT infrastructures for Degrowth
- What are potentials and challenges in creating digital low-tech infrastructures from repurposed electronics for use in climate activist movements?

build alternative futures for Degrowth











## Notes from Meeting



climate movement: Not enough for IT



IT infrastructure: critical about this term



maybe expand the the term, not only cloud and energy.

maybe also services



make sure to focus on the proper thing



services to make infrastructure last.



**Time to create interview guide.**

questions / topics list.

examples, difficulties, opportunitise

what doe they do what do they don't do?



List people, sample

nearest exisitng design, for example artists, smartphone repairs in switzerland?

also consider people that are not using this label?



activist collective

non-profits



in western european



-> Slide deck interview guide

start in broad way, go into more detailed issues over time?

what are you doing, how does it contribute to degrowth

what is your logic regarding it infrastructure

initiaitves they took' (hard, challenges)

what inspires you? how do they influence your project?

what was positive / negative

why dont you do this or that?

discareded project possibilites?

future, next steps?





Usual challenge, not be to scared

find right contacts / organizations



maybe not 100% about degrowth?



start from a person agrees. you know other contacts?

only use excerpts. not transcribe everything

recommend paper?

introduction, describe who you are, positionality, paragraph explaining perspective
