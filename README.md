# Master Thesis - Jonas Wolter

This is the work in progress repository for my written master thesis in Media Design at HEAD Geneva.

## Repository Structure



**THESIS**

Folder for current drafts of different chapters of the thesis.



**NOTES**

More or less polished notes from field research, discussions, meetings and more. Also contains some notes in German.

Most of the raw field research data are held inside a "_private" subfolder which is ignored by Git. As the field research data contains sensible personal information, this data is not publicly pushed to Github. To get access to these notes get in contact with me directly.



**PRESENTATIONS**

All presentations of the project from initial idea pitches to intermediary presentations.
