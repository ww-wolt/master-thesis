# Master Thesis Draft v0.2

How can creative reuse of old electronics contribute to a degrowth transformation?

- What are potentials and challenges in creating digital low-tech infrastructures from repurposed electronics for use in climate activist movements?

  


**Connection of Degrowth, E-Waste and climate movement**

- Climate movement has interest in creating convivial power-efficient and resource-saving tools (setting a good example)
- Climate movement has interest to create their own tools because of surveillance / police repression
- Climate movement is one of the loudest movements pushing Degrowth
- Climate movement already living Degrowth themselves?



E-Waste is a huge unused resource that will become even more important in the future



**Potentials**

Building own network infrastructure from salvaged electronics



**Risks**

Security holes in old devices, high power consumption, lot of time and motivation needed.
